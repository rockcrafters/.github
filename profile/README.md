# Welcome to the Rocks Community playground! üëã

**The world‚Äôs best portfolio and community for production-grade container
images.**

A place for community members to learn, practice and share.

</div>

## üçø Before you get started

The Rocks Community is your hub for exploring Ubuntu Rocks and everything "containers". Whether you're a seasoned Rockcraft user or Chisel enthusiast, this community is an inclusive space for learning, sharing, and connecting with fellow Ubuntu container developers.

### Community Engagement Model

The goal is to have a contributor/collaborator engagement model that motivates people to build rocks. Community members are expected to:

- work together on shared projects,
- have clear and open access for collaboration,
- participate in simple peer-review processes,
- follow workflows that are open to change,
- have equal opportunity/level playing field.

## üåà Be Part of the Rocks Community

Whether it is about rocks, Chisel, or Ubuntu containers in general, your participation in the community is more than welcome! If you are joining as someone who has something to share or someone who simply wants to learn, please remember that this is an open space for people who embrace the same interests.

There are many ways you can participate in the Rocks Community. Just find the right level of engagement that fits you:

- Join the [Rocks Community space in Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#rocks:ubuntu.com), which is your direct line of communication to both developers and users;
- The [Rocks Discourse](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/rocks) is where contributors shape ideas through open discussions;
- To become an official member of the Rocks Community, you may apply to be an external collaborator in this [Rocks Community Playground](https://github.com/ubuntu-rocks), putting you on a path to eventually becoming an official [Ubuntu Member](https://ubuntu.com/community/membership) and contributing to our Ubuntu Rocks.

### Membership Application

The [Rocks Community Playground](https://github.com/ubuntu-rocks) is a shared GitHub organization for members of the Rocks Community to get some hands-on and share their rocks.

Is it meant to be a safe space for open collaboration and as such, in order to become an external collaborator, you must meet the following requirements:

- Agree to the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/governance/code-of-conduct);
  - (Optional) Although not required for the community playground, we‚Äôd recommend [signing this Code of Conduct](https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct), as it would simplify a potential [application to become an official Ubuntu Member](https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/application);
- Acknowledge our [contributor licence agreement](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors);
  - (Optional) Although not required for the community playground, we‚Äôd also recommend [signing the contributor agreement](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors/agreement), as that would later facilitate your onboarding as an official contributor of a Canonical rock if desired;
- Open a [new Onboarding issue](https://github.com/ubuntu-rocks/.github/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&projects=ubuntu-rocks%2F2&template=onboarding.yml&title=%5Bonboarding%5D+%3Creplace+by+your+name%2Fusername%3E) and wait for a board member to get back to you.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### What is a rock?

A rock is an **OCI-compliant** container image, just like those in container registries such as Docker Hub. Rocks are, however, meticulously designed to meet cloud-native software‚Äôs security, stability, and reliability requirements. Based on Ubuntu LTS, rocks promote a secure, user-centric and predictable experience at both build and run time, through declarative build recipes, **Chisel** primitives and a powerful process manager as the entrypoint - **Pebble**.

Read the [docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rocks/) to learn more about rocks.

### ‚ÄúOCI-compliant‚Äù, what is that?

The Open Container Initiative ([OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)) is the governance structure responsible for creating the industry standards around container formats and runtimes. Those standards include the [OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec), which is followed by rocks.

### What is Pebble and why is it the entrypoint?

Pebble is a service manager that enables the seamless orchestration of a collection of local service processes as an organised set. It has been designed with custom-tailored features that enhance the overall container experience, treating processes as manageable units and thus making it the ideal candidate for the container‚Äôs init process.

Read the [docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/pebble/) to learn more about Pebble.

### What is Chisel and why is it important?

Chisel is a tool, developed by Canonical, for extracting well-defined portions (aka slices) of Ubuntu packages into a filesystem. Chiselled rocks contain only the strictly necessary for running the container application, thus reducing the image‚Äôs size and attack surface.

Read the [docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/chisel/) to learn more about Chisel.

### Does Chisel use package slices? What are those?

A package slice is what Chisel uses in order to know which files from an Ubuntu package to install. For each Ubuntu release, there‚Äôs a [Chisel release](https://github.com/canonical/chisel-releases), and each one of those will have one Slice Definitions File per Ubuntu package. This is where slices are declaratively defined. So when you try to install `package_foo`, Chisel will not install the whole `package`, but instead, only the contents defined by slice `foo`.

Read the [guides](https://github.com/canonical/chisel-releases/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#slicing-debian-packages) to learn more about package slicing.

### What is Rockcraft?

Rockcraft is a tool to create rocks! It facilitates their creation by letting you, the user, focus on the content! The chiselling of packages and the abstraction of repetitive steps (like defining the image‚Äôs entrypoint, aka Pebble) are embedded in the tool. Plus, it provides a declarative build experience that is familiar to other crafting tools like Snapcraft and Charmcraft.

Read the [docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rockcraft/) to learn more about Rockcraft.

### Why should you adopt rocks?

While they are as OCI-compliant as any other container image in your favourite container registry, the one thing to remember is that the OCI specifications focus solely on functionality and interoperability. Rocks go a step further and extend the [OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) to add focus on:

- **security**: by relying on well-supported Ubuntu releases and promoting the use of package slices to reduce the image‚Äôs size and subsequently its attack surface;
- **UX**: by empowering the container application‚Äôs entrypoint while providing a consistent deployment interface for all containers;
- **transparency**: by adopting a WYSIWYG approach towards container development and consumption, via the use of declarative builds and extended image metadata.

Read the [docs](https://canonical-rockcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/rocks/#what-sets-rocks-apart) to learn more about what sets rocks apart.

### Why should I care about the Rocks Community Playground?

This GitHub organisation is more than just a playground. It is an entrypoint for community members who want to learn, experiment, and potentially contribute to other rocks, including the ones from Canonical. Apart from being a safe space for development and experimentation, this organisation also offers a set of utilities (like reusable GitHub workflows, issue templates and examples) to speed up the collaborators‚Äô learning curve.

### How can I contribute?

You‚Äôve taken the first step just by reading this FAQ! What else can you do?

1. Be an active **member** of the Rocks Community: provide feedback and create and discuss content about rocks, Chisel, Pebble or any Ubuntu-based container image (via workshops, articles, videos, meetups, etc.). See our [communication channels](#üí¨-communication) for more.
1. Help **document** the product and tooling: you can create issues and/or improve the documentation about Rocks and the associated tools.
1. **Develop** with us: if you‚Äôre familiar with Python and/or Go, then you can create bug reports and Pull Requests for [Chisel](https://github.com/canonical/chisel), [Pebble](https://github.com/canonical/pebble) and [Rockcraft](https://github.com/canonical/rockcraft).
1. Propose **new package slices**: the addition of new package slice definitions is a community effort! Feel free to propose your slice definition in the [chisel-releases repo](https://github.com/canonical/chisel-releases/tree/main).
